        <h3>History of Mahendra Singh Dhoni</h3><br>
        <p>
        <ul class="split left">
            <li>Dhoni was born in Ranchi, Bihar (now in Jharkhand) and hails from a Hindu Rajput family
                with roots in
                Uttarakhand.</li>
            <li>He is the youngest of three children of Pan Singh and Devaki Devi.[17][18][19][20] His
                paternal village Lwali, is in Jainti Tehsil, Lamgara block of the Almora District of Uttarakhand.</li>
            <li>His
                parents moved from Uttarakhand to Ranchi, Jharkhand where his father worked as a pump operator in junior
                management position in MECON Colony situated in Doranda area in Ranchi.</li>
            <li>Unlike Dhoni, his uncle and
                cousins spell their surname as Dhauni.</li>
            <li>Previously Dhoni was the goalkeeper for his DAV Jawahar Vidya Mandir school's football team,[23] but
                after
                seeing his goalkeeping skills, coach Keshav Ranjan Banerjee, one who inspired Dhoni to be a cricketer,
                picked him to play cricket for his school team.</li>
            <li>His exceptional wicketkeeping skills allowed him to
                become the regular wicketkeeper at the Commando Cricket Club (1995–1998). Based on his performance at
                club
                cricket, he was picked for the 1997/98 season Vinoo Mankad Trophy Under-16 Championship, where he
                performed
                well.</li>
