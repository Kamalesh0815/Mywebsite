                        with roots in
                        Uttarakhand.</li>
                    <li>He is the youngest of three children of Pan Singh and Devaki Devi.His
                        paternal village Lwali, is in Jainti Tehsil, Lamgara block of the Almora District of
                        Uttarakhand.</li>
                    <li>His
                        parents moved from Uttarakhand to Ranchi, Jharkhand where his father worked as a pump operator
                        in junior

                    <li>Unlike Dhoni, his uncle and
                        cousins spell their surname as Dhauni.</li>
                    <li>Previously Dhoni was the goalkeeper for his DAV Jawahar Vidya Mandir school's football team,[23]
                        but
                        after
                        seeing his goalkeeping skills, coach Keshav Ranjan Banerjee, one who inspired Dhoni to be a
                        cricketer,
                        picked him to play cricket for his school team.</li>
                    <li>His exceptional wicketkeeping skills allowed him to
                        become the regular wicketkeeper at the Commando Cricket Club (1995–1998). Based on his
                        performance at
                        club

                        he
                        performed
                        well.</li>
